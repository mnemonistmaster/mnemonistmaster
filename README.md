- 👋 Hi, I’m @mnemonistmaster
- 👀 I’m interested in Programming, philoosophy, reading, mnemonics and learning to do things more effectively and efficiently
- 🌱 I’m currently learning by going through the Havard CS50 Course on EdX. It's taking me a while honestly. But I'll get there eventually.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing much at the moment. maybe something in the future I don't know. 
- 📫 How to reach me: I don't currently have a way of contacting me. maybe there is a way of contacting me through github?
